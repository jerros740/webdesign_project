                Bio-inspired, another approach to the exhibition 
            </h3>

                    The organisms that make up the living world have developed ingenious know-how to protect themselves, adapt to their environment and resist change. Drawing inspiration from them to imagine sustainable development models offers innovative and original solutions to current environmental issues. No longer based on what we can extract from our environment but on what we can learn from it, the bio-inspired approach takes another look at living things.
                    Alongside three ecosystems reconstituted for the exhibition and rich in numerous animal and plant species, interactive devices, manipulations, games, quizzes, models, stories to listen to and films help to understand the mechanisms at work in living things and show the many fields of application of bio-inspiration. After Atterrir, a videomapping show that questions the relationship of human beings to “nature”, the visit ends in the Dialogues space, which brings together useful resources to deepen the topics covered in the exhibition.

                Spectacle "Ruy Blas ou la folie des Moutons Noirs"

                    To take revenge on the Queen of Spain, Don Sallust invites his lackey Ruy Blas to pretend to be his nephew Don Caesar, with the aim of seducing the Queen and confusing her. Ruy Blas, secretly in love with the sovereign, lends herself to the game...
                    This is the story of a "worm in love with a star"... Les Moutons Noirs revisits in their own way, that is to say "spicy", Victor Hugo's play, in line with by Gérard Oury and his famous "Delusions of grandeur". In an ingenious and funny staging, they offer us musical and theatrical entertainment with a breathless rhythm; a modern comedy full of fantasy!
