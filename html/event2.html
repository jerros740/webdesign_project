                    This internship proposes to explore the notions of sharing and exchange, in the continuity of the theme chosen by the House of gesture and image in 2021-2022, "fraternity · sorority".
                    From different photographic approaches – landscape, portrait, collage, web image research – and writing – words, poetry, texts, etc. -, we will create postcards to share (or send) to the internal or external public at the Mgi .
                    The object created will be the means of transmission of these values which will be conveyed by the image, the word, as a "gift" to others. A metaphor of the social bond which requires fraternity, cement to build the world of tomorrow.
                    We will transform them into large formats and exhibit them at the Mgi to leave a trace of our experience. All moments of sharing the image will be documented with photography and video.

                    The toy library is like a library, with the difference that there are no books but games and toys. We play on site and we rent games. Toy libraries can be fixed or mobile, indoors or in public spaces.

                    Tom Ibarra guitar/lead
                    Noticed very early by the greatest for his virtuosity, his rich and dynamic compositions and his melodic lines, Tom Ibarra was very quickly programmed in national and international festivals. He shared the stage with Didier Lockwood and Sylvain Luc in 2015, Marcus Miller in 2016, Richard Bona in a showcase at NAMM in 2017 in Los Angeles and Kamasi Washington and Anderson Paak in 2019 during an improvised jam session on the Baiser stage. Dirty !
                    Accustomed to places and jam sessions, at 22 years old, Tom takes the reins of the jam one Sunday a month!
                    An unmissable event, an incomparable color fusion atmosphere!
