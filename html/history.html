                    <p>
                        Between 250 and 225 BC, during the Iron Age, the Parisii, a sub-tribe of the Celtic Senones,
                        settled
                        on the banks of the Seine.
                        At the beginning of the 2nd century BC, they built an oppidum, a walled fort, whose location is
                        disputed.
                        It may have been on the Île de la Cité, where bridges of an important trading route crossed the
                        Seine.
                        In his account of the Gallic wars, Julius Caesar recorded meeting with the leaders of the
                        Parisii on
                        an island in the Seine.

                        Clovis I and his successors of the Merovingian dynasty built a host of religious edifices in
                        Paris:
                        a basilica on the Montagne Sainte-Geneviève, near the site of the ancient Roman Forum;
                        the cathedral of Saint-Étienne, where Notre Dame now stands;
                        and several important monasteries, including one in the fields of the Left Bank that later
                        became
                        the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés.

                        First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte moved into the Tuileries Palace on 19 February 1800 and
                        immediately
                        began to re-establish calm and order after
                        the years of uncertainty and terror of the Revolution. He made peace with the Catholic church by
                        signing the Concordat of 1801 with Pope Pius VII;
                        masses were held again in all churches in Paris (and in the whole of France), priests were
                        allowed
                        to wear ecclesiastical clothing again,
                        and churches were permitted to ring their bells.

                    <p>
                        In the late 19th and early 20th century, Paris became the birthplace of modern art and public
                        cinema
                        projections.
                        Many notable artists lived and worked in Paris during the Belle Époque, often in Montmartre,
                        where
                        rents were low and the atmosphere congenial.
                        Auguste Renoir rented space at 12 Rue Cartot in 1876 to paint his Bal du moulin de la Galette,
                        which
                        depicts a dance at Montmartre on a Sunday
                        afternoon. Maurice Utrillo lived at the same address from 1906 to 1914, and Raoul Dufy shared an
                        atelier there from 1901 to 1911.
